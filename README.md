### The Speed of Earth

you think you're quick  
earth is quicker    

her feet reach to yours<br>
the moment before you step  

she breathes into you<br>
the moment before you inhale    

she unveils herself to you<br>
the moment before you look  

and she makes extraordinary sense<br>
the moment before you puzzle  

how she serves you!<br>
how you mistrust her!  
 
testing her, when she has brought<br>
all devotion, in great simplicity

***


### La velocità della Terra

tu pensi d'essere veloce  
ma la terra lo è di più  

il suo piede precede i tuoi<br>
appena prima del tuo passo  

lei respira in te<br>
appena prima che tu inali  

lei si svela a te<br>
appena prima del tuo sguardo  

e tutto ha un senso straordinario<br>
un attimo prima che tu ti confonda  

ah! come ti serve!<br>
e come sei malfidato!  

a testarla, lei che ti ha portato<br>
ogni riguardo, in tutta semplicità

*…*
